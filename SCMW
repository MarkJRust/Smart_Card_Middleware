Problems arise for credit cardholders when they fail to pay their bills on time, and accrue interest on money owed. This is a risk many take to enjoy to benefits such as cash back rewards and frequent flyer miles, at the risk of damaging their credit score.  Debit cardholders are at risk if their card is compromised and may stand to have their checking accounts emptied, with no protection or insurance to cover the loss.

SmartCard MiddleWare (SCMW) takes the benefits from credit and debit cards and combines them with a simple service. No longer will a credit card holder accidentally spend more then they have or fail to pay their bill at the end of the month. 

Users of SCMW will have their checking account balances checked before a credit card purchase is authorized. If the cost of the current charge is less than one's checking account balance the card will be authorized, the transaction completed, and the total cost of the purchase will be transferred out of one's checking to pay off the expense. Once this process is complete, the user will receive a text message with their updated balance.  If one does not have enough funds to cover the purchase, the card will be declined. The user will receive a text message letting them know the cost of the charge they attempted to complete and remind them of their current balance.  

As a result of SCMW, users can reap the benefits of credit card rewards and build their credit score with no risk that is normally associated with having a credit card.
